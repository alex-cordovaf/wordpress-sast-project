A developer-first REST API to decouple WooCommerce on the frontend. Fast, secure, customizable, easy.

== Description ==

**CoCart: Headless WooCommerce API for Developers**

[CoCart](https://cocartapi.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) gives you a developer-first REST API to decouple WooCommerce on the frontend. Build modern storefronts with full control over auth, sessions, cart and product flows.

#### Why developers choose CoCart

* ✅ **Source of truth** - Built on WooCommerce Data Stores and mirrors most WooCommerce hooks, ensuring broad compatibility from the start.
* 🔐 **Session management** - Lightweight, cookie‑less session keys stored in the database. Concurrency-safe.
* 🔑 **Flexible authentication** - Log in via email, username, or phone. No admin API keys required.
  - Optional JWT via official add‑on.
* 🌍 **CORS control** - First‑party CORS so cross‑domain frontends “just work”.
* 🛒 **Real‑time cart management** - Validate items/coupons, calculate totals in a single call.
* 🔎 **Product search** - Query by name, SKU, or ID — authenticated or not — with flexible filters.
* 🧩 **Extendable Callbacks** - Add your own logic with custom callbacks. No new endpoints needed.
* 🛠 **Works with Woo Checkout** - Load any cart session into WooCommerce’s native checkout.
* 💸 **Name Your Price** - Support donation-based pricing with built-in flexibility.
* 📦 **Bulk Cart Requests** - Combine multiple API calls into one for better performance.

* PHP v7.4

= Recommended Requirements =

* WordPress v6.3 or higher.
* WooCommerce v9.0 or higher.
* PHP v8.0 or higher.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of CoCart, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "CoCart" and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Upgrading =

It is recommended that anytime you want to update CoCart that you get familiar with what's changed in the release.

CoCart publishes [release notes via the changelog](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#developers).

CoCart uses Semver practices. The summary of Semver versioning is as follows:

- *MAJOR* version when you make incompatible API changes.
- *MINOR* version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
- *PATCH* version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

You can read more about the details of Semver at [semver.org](https://semver.org/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does CoCart do? =

CoCart provides a REST API that is ready to decouple WooCommerce away from WordPress.

= Who should use CoCart? =

Pretty much everyone who wants a faster eCommerce store to improve their business. WooCommerce runs multiple requests for multiple steps. We avoid the hassle of needing multiple requests for these steps and process them all together.

CoCart is perfect for eCommerce owners and developers who want to create an eCommerce app for mobile or a custom frontend shopping experience completely using the REST API.

= Are there any limitations? =

CoCart is designed with developers in mind allowing for complete control to customize or add support for a plugin to work with CoCart. CoCart does its best to work out of the box but if there is a compatibility issue with a plugin that you would like to work with CoCart. We would be happy to hear about it.

= What is the source of truth? =

CoCart sources the WooCommerce’s Data Stores API and repeats most WooCommerce hooks to provide a wider array of support for most WooCommerce extensions out of the box.

= Does CoCart work for multi-site network? =

Yes. Just install CoCart and activate it on the sites you want to use CoCart.

= Can I have WordPress running on one domain and my headless eCommerce on another domain? =

Absolutely. That is what CoCart is mainly developed for. You just need to enable CORS. You can do that easily with [the CORS add-on](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cocart-cors/) or you can manually enable it via the filters available [in the documentation](https://cocartapi.com/docs/#filters-api-access-cors-allow-all-cross-origin-headers).

= Will CoCart interfere with other plugins? =

The majority of plugins are not REST API specific so it shouldn't. However, while we allow the source of truth for compatibility, there may be a WooCommerce extension that returns data via an action hook that the REST API cannot understand during a specific action and may fail the response.

If that does happen, simply report the situation with as much detail as possible on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues) and we will try our best to find a solution.

= How do I set up CoCart? =

You will first need WooCommerce installed and set up to your configurations. Then install CoCart, activate and you're ready to start using the REST API following the API Reference provided.

> Please check the requirements listed in the [installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/#installation) section.

= Why use CoCart if the WooCommerce API already exists? =

The WooCommerce REST API is primarily for store management (orders, products, coupons, etc.) and is designed for authenticated admins/apps. It isn’t built for customer cart flows.

CoCart fills this gap. It's specifically built for frontend cart handling where you want a seamless shopping experience that mimics traditional WooCommerce behavior but via API.

It’s optimized, extendable, and built for performance in decoupled setups.

= Why use CoCart and not WooCommerce’s Store API? =

To better answer this question in detail, please read [our comparison article](https://cocartapi.com/cocart-vs-woocommerces-store-api/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink).

= Can we support SSO? =

CoCart itself doesn’t use cookie-based authentication — it supports Basic and JWT Authentication (via add-on), which are stateless and frontend-friendly. So when a user logs in through your headless site/app, they're authenticated for API requests — including cart operations.

= Can we call other WP APIs alongside CoCart? =

Definitely. CoCart doesn't block or replace any part of the WP or WC APIs — it works alongside them. Once authenticated, your headless site/app can access any available endpoint, whether from CoCart, WooCommerce, or custom APIs you've built.

= Do I need to have coding skills to use CoCart? =

As this plugin provides an REST API built for developers, you will need to have some coding knowledge to use it.

= Where can I find documentation for CoCart? =

You can find the documentation [here](https://cocartapi.com/docs/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink).

= Can I change the formatting of values, add and change details to the responses? =

You certainly can. There are over 200+ filters available to customize to your needs.

= Why does CoCart use a custom session handler and table in the database? =

If you're familiar with WooCommerce, you may be wondering why using a custom session handler at all instead of the WooCommerce default session handler? A number of reasons but the ones that really matter are.

- The default session handler only supports cookies.
- The default session handler only saves changes at the end of the request in the `shutdown` hook.
- The default session handler has no support for concurrent requests.
- The default session handler **does not support guest customers**.
- The default session handler **does not store additional data that may be required to help you**.
- The default session handler **does not allow support for POS capability**.
- More consistent with modern web.

= Is "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" plugin supported? =

No. "WooCommerce Shipping and Tax" ignores any custom REST APIs from allowing the ability to calculate the taxes from TaxJar except for WooCommerce Blocks and JetPack. We don't recommend it. However, [TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/) plugin is supported.

= Is "TaxJar for WooCommerce" plugin supported? =

If you have "[TaxJar for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxjar-simplified-taxes-for-woocommerce/)" v3.2.5 or above and CoCart v3.0 or above installed... then yes, it is supported.

= Can I use any modern stack? =

Yes, you can use your preferred tools and favorite modern technologies like [Astro](https://astro.build/), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) and more giving you endless flexibility and customization.

= Where can I report bugs? =

Report bugs on the [CoCart GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/issues). You can also notify us via the [Discord community server](https://cocartapi.com/community/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) in the #bug-report channel – be sure to search the forum to confirm that the error has not already been reported.

= CoCart is awesome! Can I contribute? =

Yes, you can! Join in on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/blob/trunk/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and follow the [development blog](https://cocart.dev/news/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) to stay up-to-date with everything happening in the project.

= Is CoCart translatable? =

Yes! CoCart is deployed with full translation and localization support via the ‘cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce’ text-domain.

= Where can I get help or talk other users about CoCart core? =

If you get stuck, you can ask for help in the [CoCart support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce/) or [join the CoCart Community on Discord](https://cocartapi.com/community/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink) where you will find like minded developers who help each other out.

`
add_filter( 'cocart_get_customer_billing_country', function( $value ) {
	if ( WC()->countries->country_exists( $value ) ) {
		return WC()->countries->get_countries()[ $value ];
	}

	return $value;
}, 10, 1);
`

= v4.3.21 - 20th February, 2025 =
